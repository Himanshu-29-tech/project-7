# FarmAid Core AI - Standalone Python Script
# This is a simplified, dummy implementation for hackathon prototyping.
# It handles image symptom detection (simulated), MCQ generation, suggestions, and basic progress tracking.
# No external ML libraries required for this version (uses PIL for image handling).
# Install PIL if needed: pip install pillow
# For real ML, replace detect_symptoms with TensorFlow/Keras as discussed earlier.
